## About the project

The web application offers an infinite-scrolling effect, loading new images as you scroll. All images feature lazy loading and a low-resolution background to speed up loading times. You can add your favorite photos to your liked collection by hovering over them. If you prefer a dark theme, you can easily switch between dark and light modes using the header. Additionally, you can browse through images endlessly by hovering and selecting the "See More" button. This allows you to find similar images more easily. You can also download freely a image of choice. The application is also mobile-friendly and has been tested on the Chrome browser.

### Future Improvements ðŸ“•

Here are some potential areas for improvement in the application:

1. Creating Unit, Integration, and End-to-End testing to ensure stability.
2. Use Storybook to isolate reusable components for better scalability.
3. Implementing responsive image features to improve loading time.
4. Add support for different browsers to ensure compatibility and accessibility.
5. Implement more comprehensive error handling and error messages to guide users effectively.
6. As for now all liked photos are saved in LocalStorage with a maximum storage space. To prevent this, in further implementations I will use IndexedDB instead
